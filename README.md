# BioDegradable-MachineLearning

Dataset: An augmented and edited version of the Dataset QSAR biodegradation Data Set

DO NOT DOWNLOAD the Dataset from the UCI Repository - Use the edited and augmented version in this assignment (biodegradable_a.csv)

# Aim

We should provide the best possible classification models using whatever method covered

Variable to Classify is Biodegradable

Models should examine different hyperparameters and select the best one [Remember: everything else being similar, the simplest models should be preferred]

# Processing notes

Data is not normalized

Data has categorical and continuous variables

Data has missing values which should be handled accordingly

Data has 41 columns, and not all are important

# Objectives

Produce the best Classification model

For the best model, test different hyperparameters

Identify the most significant features
